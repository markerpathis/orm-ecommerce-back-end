## Description
The objective of this project was to build the back end for a mock e-commerce site. We were required to create the models for Product, Category, Tag, and Product Tag and set up the associations between the models. We also needed to set up the API routes, which would allow you to return, create, update, or delete a product, cateory, or tag.

## Installation

In order to use this application the user needs to install the Node dependencies with npm, by running the following command in their command-line - “npm install”. Dependencies include:
- dotenv
- express
- mysql2
- sequelize

The user should also create their own .env file, and update the following information:
DB_NAME=''
DB_USER=''
DB_PASSWORD=''

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, the user should use mysql to run the schema.sql file to set up the database and tables. If the user would also like to input some data, they should run the index.js file in the route api folder. After these steps, the user can enter the following command into the command-line to turn on the server - "node index.js". API requests can then be made using software such as Insomnia.
